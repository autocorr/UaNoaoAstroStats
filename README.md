UaNoaoAstroStats
================
Code for UA-NOAO Astrostatistics working group.


Getting started with git
========================
To get started, first download `git`. If you're using Linux, it should be available in distribution's package manager. If you're using Mac, you can download it from the `git` webpage: http://git-scm.com/download/mac. You can also download it through `homebrew`, although you may need the "developer tools" to compile things available through the Mac Store.

The documentation on `git`'s home page can be somewhat dense, but GitHub has a quite succinct "getting started" guide, that you should have seen when creating an account. But for an executive summary, the simplest way to make contributions is to:


  * Make a GitHub account
  * Navigate to this page and click the "Fork" button in the repository's upper right hand corner (you may also want to "Watch" and "Star" the repository as well for future reference).
  * Use `$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/UaNoaoAstrStats` to make a local copy of your fork on your machine
  * Make your edits
  * *Commit* your changes `$ git commit -a -m 'My short explanation'`
  * Repeat for more changes
  * *Checkout* your commits `$ git checkout`
  * *Push* your changes to your fork `$ git push`
  * Go to your fork's GitHub page, and click that little green button with the arrows to make a *pull request*, with an explanation, and they can be integrated into the main repo.
  * The code in the pull request will be viewable as an "Issue" that others can comment on and review.
  * Congratulations, you have contributed code to a public GitHub repo!
  

We can cover more effecient workflows in our meetings, such as making changes to branches rather than directly editing `master`. But note you can make direct changes to this text as well! You can even use the "Edit" button to make changes within your browser.
